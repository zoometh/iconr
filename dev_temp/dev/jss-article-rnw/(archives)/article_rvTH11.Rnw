\Abstract{
  By definition, Prehistorical societies are characterised by the absence of a writing system. Prehistorical times cover more than 99\% of the human living. Even if it is being discussed, first symbolic manifestations start around 200,000 BC \citep{dErrico00}. The duration from first symbolic expressions to start of writing represents 97\% of the human living. In illiterate societies, testimonies of symbolic systems mostly come from iconography (ceramic decorations, rock-art, statuary, etc.) and signs are displayed mostlty a discontinuous figures which can have different relationships one with another. An iconographical composition can be "read" as a spatial distribution of features having intrinsic values possibily having meaningful relationships one with another depending on their pairwise spatial proximities. 

  To understand meaningful associations of signs, geometric tools, graph analysis and statistical analysis offer great tools to recognize iconographical patterns and to infer collective conventions. We present the \pkg{decorr} \proglang{R} package which ground concepts, methods and tools to analyse ancient iconographical systems.

\section[Introduction]{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

For decades, study of ancient iconography was linked to history of religion because closely linked to symbolism, believes and religions. Since the \textit{New Archaeology} developpement during the 60's \citep{Clarke14}, symbolic expressions start to be studied with the same formal methods (statistics, seriations, distribution maps, etc.) as any another aspect of social organisation: settlement patterns, tools \emph{chaine op√©ratoire}, susbsitence strategies, etc. \citep{Renfrew91}, \citep{LeroiGourhan92}. But unlike many aspects of the material culture -- a flint blade for cutting, a pottery for containing, a house for living --, the function of an iconographic composition cannot be drawn directly from itself. Whether study of ancient iconography had  undergone significative improvements at the site scale -- with GIS, database, paleoclimatic restitutions, etc. -- and at the sign scale with the development of archaeological sciences -- radiocarbon dating, use-wear analysis, elemental analysis, etc. --, these improvement do not necessarly help to understand the semantic content of the iconography.
Semantics or semiotics can be defined as a system of conventional signs organised also in conventional manners.  
Until our days, formal methods to study ancient iconography Semantics, has been mostlty been grounded (explicitly or not) on the prime principle of Saussurian linguistic: the 'linearity of the signifier' \citep{Saussure89}. Writing is one of the most rational semiographical system with a clear distinction between signified and signifier -- specially in alphabetic and binary writings -- and the development of the signified on a horizontal, vertical or boustrophedon axis. 
Let us take the example of the word "\code{art}" which contains three vertices (\code{a}, \code{r}, \code{t}) and two edges (one between \code{a} and \code{r}, the other between \code{r} and \code{t}). In \proglang{R}, these features, concatenated in this order with a \code{paste0()}, is \code{art}, and not \code{rat},

     edge.arrow.size=.5)
@
\captionof{figure}[directional links]{concatenate of \code{a}, \code{r} and \code{t} graphical units is \code{art}.}
\end{figure}

But, as stated, in Prehistorical the writing system does not exists. Spatial relationships between graphical features are not necessarly linear and directed but could most probably be more multi-directional and undirected: the direction of the interactions of pairwise graphical units can be in any order.  

\begin{figure}[H]
<<art_or_rat, echo=FALSE, fig=TRUE, height=3>>=
library(extrafont)
loadfonts(device = "win")
ugs <- data.frame(name=c("a","r","t"))

g <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(lks, directed=FALSE, vertices= ugs)

     vertex.color="white",

     vertex.size=80,

     )
@
\captionof{figure}[multidirectional links]{Potential spatial relations between \code{a}, \code{r} and \code{t} graphical units.}
\end{figure}

Applying the Saussurian model to any prehistorical graphical content had led to tedious division of the iconographical content with, for example, graphical as a relationship of \emp{figures} grouping graphical units, \emp{patterns} grouping \emp{figures}, \emp{motives} grouping \emp{patterns}, etc., until the entire decorated support is described and can be compared to another decoration (XXX). But during this \emph{decomposition} process, many imprecisions occur:
\begin{itemize}
  \item groups and relationships are often defined empirically
  \item their level of significance are often implicit 
  \item the iconographical and spatial proximities between graphical units and categories of graphical units are not quantified
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, due to the inherent variability of iconography, most of the studies developp proper descriptive vocabularies, singular relationships of categories, idosyncratic methods in a site-dependend or period-dependend scales. This limits drastically the possibility to conduct cross-cultural comparisons and to draw a synthesis of humankind's symbolism at a large scale and over the long-term. 
\\
\\
In this article we present the \proglang{R} package \pkg{decorr}. Its purpose is to formalise a method based on geometric graphs to analyse any graphical content. As any formal system, iconography can be modelled as spatial features related one with the other depending on rules of spatial proximities. The idea is that a graphical system can be represented by vertices connected (or not) to each other with edges. This package has been grounded on the seminal work of C. Alexander \citep{Alexander08} and its first IT implementation by T. Huet \citep{Huet18a}. 

\section[Model]{Model} \label{sec:model}

Graph theory offers a conceptual framework and indices (global at the entire graph scale, local at the vertex scale) to deal with notions of networks, relationships and neighbourhoods. The spatial levels of the graphical units can be retrieve by a planar graph (Graph Theory) and a spatial (GIS) analysis.
Nodes and edges -- repectively for graphical units and their connexion -- are created on a GIS interface. In the GIS, the decoration figure is open in the first place in a new project with no projection. The decoration image will be considerated as the basemap of the project and will cover the region of interest of the analysis. The decoration image can be binarized where graphical units are considerated active and the undecorated parts of the support, or background, are considerated inactive. After what, the decoration image is tiled. A simplier solution will be to create directly centroids over the graphical units. The \emph{x} and \emph{y} coordinates of the nodes are relative to the decoration and measured in pixels.
Exist a link between a couple of graphical units when these graphical units share a border. A planar graph is constructed from grahical units (nodes) and their proximity links (edges). This model is a Voronoi diagram of the support where the Voronoi seeds are the graphical units. Its geographical equivalent is a Thiessen polygon.


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{gis}
\caption{\label{fig:gis} GIS interface. A) Original decoration of the Late Bronze Age \emp{Cerro Muriano 1} stelae (drawing: \cite{DiazGuardamino10}) with its extent (\code{xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax}); B) After the polygonisation of the graphical units, including the border of the stelae, the Voronoi cells, the centroid of graphical units and the links between graphical units having adjacent cells (ie, sharing a border) are calculated; C) For each graphical units, \emph{x} and \emph{y} are calculated; D) At least one variable, like the \code{type} of the graphical units is defined in order to compute composition analysis.}
\end{figure}

This model has a minimal of \emph{a priori} definitions. Those only concern the graphical units (type, technology, color, orientation, size, etc.). Between two graphical units the links are conventionaly represented with a plain line. But sometimes a graphical unit can be divided into a main unit (eg, a man) and attribute units (eg, a helmet, a sword). So, the links between the main unit and the attribute units are directed and displayed with a dashed line.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{gis_1}
\caption{\label{fig:gis1} GIS interface. The graphical unit 'casque' (helmet) and the 'sexe\_masculin' (male sex) are two attributes of the graphical unit 'personnage' (character).}
\end{figure}


The \code{r} graphical unit receives two edges, so its centrality degree is 2, \code{r} is also central in the graph so its betweeness degree is 1.

\section{The R package decorr} \label{sec:models}

The \pkg{decorr} package can be downloaded from GitHub

R>   devtools::install_github("zoometh/iconr")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}
%


\subsection{External package} \label{sec:ext_pck}

The \pkg{decorr} package imports the following packages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \pkg{magick} for image manipulation \citep{Ooms18}
  \item \pkg{igraph} for graph and network analysis \citep{Csardi06} 
  \item \pkg{rgdal}  to read shapefiles of nodes and/or edges \citep{Bivand19}
  \item \pkg{grDevices} for colors and font plotting, \pkg{graphics} for graphics, \pkg{utils} and \pkg{methods} for formally defined methods and \emph{varia} methods (all combinations, etc.) \citep{R19}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{External data} \label{sec:ext_data}

The training dataset is a selection of four decorated Late Bronze age stelae of the SW Iberian peninsula. 


<<results=tex, echo=FALSE>>=
imgs.df <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "imgs.tsv", package = "decorr"),
                   sep="\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
print(xtable::xtable(imgs.df,
               caption="studied corpus",
               label="Test_table",
               size=7),
      include.rownames=FALSE)
@

The default dataframe storing the inventory of decorations is \code{imgs}. The field \code{imgs$idf} is the short name of the decoration, useful during statistical analysis. The concatened of  \code{imgs$site} and \code{imgs$decor} is the primary key of each decoration. All decoration drawings belongs to \citep{DiazGuardamino10}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{corpus}
\caption{\label{fig:corpus} Dataset of four stelae showing the information on the decoration (\code{site}, \code{decor} and \code{img}) and the dimensions in pixel of the decoration image}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Functions} \label{sec:functions}

The first step is to load \code{nodes}, \code{edges} and \code{images} dataframes

<<read_df, echo=TRUE>>=
imgs <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "imgs.csv", package = "decorr"),
                   sep="\t",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
nodes <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "nodes.csv", package = "decorr"),
                    sep="\t",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
edges <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "edges.csv", package = "decorr"),
                    sep="\t",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
@

Once done, the list of graphs can be stored with the \code{list_dec()} function.

\begin{Code}
list_dec(imgs,
         nodes,
         edges,
         var="type")
\end{Code}

This function allows to store undirected graphs for each decorations stored into \code{nodes}, \code{edges} and \code{images} dataframes and store the graphs in a list. The join between these \emp{dataframes} is done on the two fields \code{site} and \code{decor}.

<<f.lgrph, echo=TRUE>>=
library(decorr)
lgrph <- list_dec(imgs,nodes,edges,var="type")
@

The first graph of can be plotted

<<plotg, echo=TRUE, fig=TRUE, height=3,width=3>>=
plot(lgrph[[1]],
     vertex.size = 10,
     vertex.label.cex =.8)
@

The \code{labels_shadow()} function is a re-use of the \code{shadowtext()} function from the \pkg{TeachingDemos} package \citep{Snow20}.\\

The others \pkg{decorr} package functions can be divided into:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item functions for a single decoration
 \item functions for comparisons between different decorations
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Single decoration functions} \label{sec:functions_one}

Functions allowing to model a single decoration with a geometric graph are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{read_nds()} and \code{read_eds()} allow to read respectively a file of nodes and a file of edges (\code{.tsv} or \code{.shp} files)
  \item \code{plot_dec_grph ()} allows to plot a geometric graph over a decoration image
\end{itemize}

The Torrejon Rubio 1 stele decoration graph, with nodes, type of nodes, and edges, can be plotted

<<plotcm, echo=TRUE, fig=TRUE, height=10,width=5>>=
# library(decorr)
nds.df <- read_nds(site = "Torrejon Rubio", decor = "Torrejon Rubio 1", dev = ".tsv",
                   doss = system.file("extdata", package = "decorr"))
eds.df <- read_eds(site = "Torrejon Rubio", decor = "Torrejon Rubio 1", dev = ".tsv",
                   doss = system.file("extdata", package = "decorr"))
img.graph <- plot_dec_grph(nds.df = nds.df,
                           eds.df = eds.df,
                           site = "Torrejon Rubio",
                           decor = "Torrejon Rubio 1",
                           doss = system.file("extdata", package = "decorr"),
                           lbl.txt = "type",
                           shw = c("nodes","edges"))
plot(img.graph)
@

\subsection{Decoration comparisons function} \label{sec:functions_one}

Functions allowing to compare different decorations with geometric graphs are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{list_nds_compar()} and \code{list_eds_compar()} allow to compare respectively the common nodes and the common edges between two decorations
  \item \code{plot_nds_compar()} and \code{plot_eds_compar()} allow to plot and save two figures side-by-side for a decorations pairwise with, respectively, common nodes and common edges identified
  \item \code{same_nds()} and \code{same_eds()} allow to repectively count matching nodes and matching edges between decoration pairwises
\end{itemize}

Comparisons between pairwise of decorations are first stored into list. These comparisons are performed for nodes and/or edges. There are four (4) decorations in the default dataset, so there is $\frac{4!}{(4-2)!2!}={6}$ pairwise comparisons

<<results=tex, echo=FALSE>>=
# set wd to data folder
# setwd(system.file("extdata", package = "decorr"))
library(decorr)
g.compar <- list_eds_compar(lgrph,"type")
df.edges.compar <- data.frame(decorA=c(g.compar[[1]][[1]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[2]][[1]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[3]][[1]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[4]][[1]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[5]][[1]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[6]][[1]]$decor),
                              decorB=c(g.compar[[1]][[2]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[2]][[2]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[3]][[2]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[4]][[2]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[5]][[2]]$decor,
                                       g.compar[[6]][[2]]$decor))
xtable::xtable(df.edges.compar,
               caption="comparison dataframe",
               label="Test_table_1",
               size=7)
@

The \code{plot_nds_compar()}and \code{plot_eds_compar()} functions create a \code{.png} image of two decorations plotted side-by-side with common nodes or edges identified. Functions returns also the name of the image 

<<plotedscomp echo=TRUE, fig=TRUE, height=14,width=14>>=
library(magick)
eds_compar <- plot_eds_compar(g.compar, c(1,4), doss = system.file("extdata", package = "decorr"))
plot(image_read(eds_compar))
@

\code{same_nds()} and \code{same_eds()} allow to repectively count matching nodes and matching edges between decoration pairwises. The result is a square matrix with all pairwise comparisons and the number of common nodes or edges in the cells.

<<results=tex, echo=TRUE>>=
df.same_edges <- same_eds(lgrph,"type")
print(xtable::xtable(df.same_edges,
                     caption="same edges",
                     label="Test_table_2",
                     size=7,
                     digits=c(0)),
      include.rownames=TRUE)
@

For these two last exemples, the edges comparisons between the decoration 1 (Cerro Muriano 1) and the decoration 4 (Zarza de Montsanchez) show that they have two common edges.
